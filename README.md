# Mean App Example

The project's purpouse is to prove MEAN stack knowledge.

## Angular Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Node.js Development server

Run `npm run start:serve` for a live dev server. Requests will be routed on 3000 port by default.

## Use of the application

I created 3 different users to log in the application, usernames and passwords are respectively the following:

  - root / root
  - user / password
  - test / test

Each one of these already have some stored guests. 
Platform funcionalities are intuitive, i think there's no need of more explanation.
